# AWS Connect Analytics Solution

## Current Status

We've assessed the AWS Connect Analytics infrastructure and found:

1. **Athena Resources** - ✅ Working
   - Workgroup: `connect-analytics-c4ezxzvi` exists and is functional
   - Successfully ran test queries

2. **Glue Resources** - ✅ Working
   - Database: `connect_ctr_database_c4ezxzvi` exists
   - Crawler: `connect-ctr-crawler` configured and scheduled
   - Created test table: `sample_contact_events`

3. **S3 Buckets** - ✅ Working
   - Data bucket: `connect-ctr-data-c4ezxzvi`
   - Athena results bucket: `connect-analytics-athena-results-c4ezxzvi`

4. **Multi-Region Architecture**
   - Athena and Glue in eu-west-2 (London) - same region as Connect
   - Timestream in eu-west-1 (Ireland) - see TIMESTREAM_SOLUTION.md

## Analytics Architecture

The Connect Analytics pipeline follows this flow:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Amazon Connect CTR (Contact Trace Records) stream to Kinesis

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Kinesis -> Firehose -> S3 (historical data storage)
   - Kinesis -> Lambda -> Timestream (real-time metrics)

3. **Data Cataloging**:
   - Glue Crawler processes S3 data
   - Creates table metadata in Glue Catalog

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Athena for SQL queries against S3 data
   - Timestream for real-time metrics and time-series analysis

5. **Visualization**:
   - Grafana dashboards connecting to both Athena and Timestream

## Testing Performed

- Verified existence of all critical resources
- Successfully created a test table in Glue
- Ran Athena queries against the database
- Ensured permissions are correctly configured

## Next Steps

1. **Data Verification**:
   - Generate test CTR data using the provided script
   - Verify data appears in S3 and is crawled by Glue
   - Confirm Athena can query the actual data

2. **Dashboard Setup**:
   - Connect Grafana to both Athena and Timestream data sources
   - Import the provided dashboard templates

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for pipeline health
   - Configure Grafana alerts for business metrics

## Helpful Commands

```bash
# Check Glue databases
aws glue get-databases --region eu-west-2

# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls | grep connect

# Run Athena query
aws athena start-query-execution \
  --query-string "SELECT * FROM database.table LIMIT 10" \
  --work-group "connect-analytics-c4ezxzvi" \
  --region eu-west-2

# Get Athena query results
aws athena get-query-results \
  --query-execution-id "query-id" \
  --region eu-west-2
```
